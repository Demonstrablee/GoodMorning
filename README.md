# GoodMorning
A Webpage that tells you goodmorning and hopefully brightens your day.

What I'm trying to do:

Take the users name save that to a database so that when they come back to the webpage it will "remember them"
Get an API to pull random pictures from a database and then place them on screen accompanied by the message 'good morrning'




# Inspiration:
I do this sort of thing with my cousins sending them random things either something I find that morning or the previous evening 
They'll react wildly and I have fun so I wanted to do something that sort of reminds me of this.
